# World_Weather_Analysis

## Main Focus
Apply analysis, visualizations and statustical skills while retreive specific data from a website through application programming interface or API. 

## Purpose
Using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Python Requests, gmaps, APIs and JSON traversals to collect weather data from over 500 cities around the world. Then, based on the beta testers' input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta users will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally using the Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
